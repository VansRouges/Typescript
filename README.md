## 12 Interesting Things About TypeScript that I learnt
- TypeScript provides all the power of JavaScript and all the strong-typing of C#
- TypeScript compiles (or more precisely, transpiles) to JavaScript. The cool part is that you can choose the version of JavaScript that the TypeScript compiler will produce. You can select any version of JavaScript via the `--target` compiler option that you want, starting with the ECMAScript 3 standard. You can even choose `ESNext`, which will target the latest proposed language features from the ECMAScript committee.
- TypeScript provides types and a compiler that enforces those types. No more chasing down bugs from weakly-typed assignments. No more passing improperly typed parameters. TypeScript can provide coding-time and compile-time error checking.
- TypeScript has all the modern language features like generics, enums, OOP, interfaces, conditional types, decorators, modules, etc.
